# FS19_CruiseControlLevels
3 speed levels for cruise control

## What is this?
CruiseControlLevels adds three speed levels to the cruise control. Basically, this script is like [SpeedControl by Heady](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=125190).
But unlike SpeedControl, CruiseControlLevels keeps the default cruise control keys (1,2,3) with their default function (increase/decrease speed, activate cruise control). Switching speed levels is possible with lshift+4 (1->2->3) or lctrl+4 (3->2->1).
Default speeds for these levels are 10, 20 and max speed.

## What do I need?
